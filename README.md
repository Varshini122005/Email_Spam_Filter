# Email_Spam_Filter
The Email Spam Classification Web Application is a machine learning-based system
designed to classify emails as either Spam or Not Spam. The system utilizes a Naive 
Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks, to analyze the content 
of emails and determine their classification. 
The application is developed using the Flask web framework, providing an interactive 
user interface for users to easily upload email files or paste email content for 
classification. The machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, 
where each email is marked as either spam or ham (non-spam).
